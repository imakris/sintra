// Ring reading policy
// ===================

// The waiting policy is 3 phase, adaptive:
// - Phase 1: Fast spin (50μs) for ultra-low latency
// - Phase 2: Precision sleep cycles (1ms) for moderate latency with low CPU
// - Phase 3: True blocking sleep (semaphore) for no CPU burn on stalls
// Memory barriers ensure cache coherency even with stale shared memory.

    // part as well.
