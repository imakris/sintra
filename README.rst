Sintra
======

A C++ library for type safe Interprocess signal dispatch and remote procedure calls.

Overview
--------

The library was initially written to provide a message dispatch mechanism for VIK, an OpenGL based GUI framework, which is currently not open source. This version of the library is repurposed for more generic usage and it is currently under development.

Sintra is a header-only library.
It has dependencies on header-only boost libraries (interprocess, type_index, fusion, atomic, bind).

It will need a C++17 compiler.
