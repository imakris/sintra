# Active Tests Configuration
#
# This file controls which tests are built and run by the test infrastructure.
# Format: <test_path> <iterations>
#   - test_path: relative path to test from tests/ directory (without .cpp extension or sintra_ prefix)
#   - iterations: number of times to run the test (minimum: 1)
#   - Lines starting with # are ignored (comments)
#   - Empty lines are ignored
#
# Examples:
#   ping_pong_test 200
#   manual/some_problematic_test 10
#
# The build system will only build tests listed here (not commented).
# The test runner will run each test for the specified number of iterations.

# Focused run: only the midflight join test, hammered to catch flakiness
join_swarm_midflight_test               2000

# Manual/reproduction tests (commented out by default)
# Uncomment to enable these tests (they may fail by design)

# manual/hang_test 1
# manual/coordinator_crash_children_hang_test 1
# manual/children_crash_coordinator_deadlock_test 1
# manual/temp_ring 1

# Test for lldb stack capture with multi-process hang
# This test intentionally hangs to verify lldb captures all threads/processes
