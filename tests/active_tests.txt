# Active Tests Configuration
#
# This file controls which tests are built and run by the test infrastructure.
# Format: <test_path> <iterations>
#   - test_path: relative path to test from tests/ directory (without .cpp extension or sintra_ prefix)
#   - iterations: number of times to run the test (minimum: 1)
#   - Lines starting with # are ignored (comments)
#   - Empty lines are ignored
#
# Examples:
#   ping_pong_test 200
#   manual/some_problematic_test 10
#
# The build system will only build tests listed here (not commented).
# The test runner will run each test for the specified number of iterations.

# Debug focus for semaphore/receive failures in CI.
# Iterations are intentionally huge to reproduce rare failures.
