Sintra is a C++ library for type safe Interprocess signal dispatch and remote procedure calls.

The library was written to provide the dispatch mechanism for VIK, an OpenGL based GUI framework, which is currently not open source.

Sintra has only headers, but also has various dependencies on boost (interprocess, filesystem, type_index, fusion, chrono, atomic, thread, program_options, bind), some of which require linking.

It has been tested on Windows with Visual Studio 2015 and Linux with gcc 6.3.
However, it has not been tested very thoroughly on Linux.

Please see the examples for usage.
