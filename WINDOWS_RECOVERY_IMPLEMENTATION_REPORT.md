# Windows Process Recovery Hang - Implementation Report

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: The `recovery_test` executable hangs 100% of the time on Windows (but passes on Linux) when attempting to recover from a crashed process. The hang occurs at the entry point of `main()` in the recovered process, before any user code executes.

**Root Cause**: Abandoned mutex locks in shared memory ring buffer control files. When a process crashes while holding the `ownership_mutex` in a `Message_ring_W` control structure, Windows does not automatically mark Boost.Interprocess mutexes as `WAIT_ABANDONED`. The recovered process hangs trying to acquire the same abandoned mutex.

**Progress Achieved**:
- **0% → 70% pass rate** through incremental fixes
- Phase 2a (PID tracking only): 0% → 65%
- Phase 2a-enhanced (mutex reconstruction): 65% → 70%
- Phase 1+2a combined (control file deletion + mutex reconstruction): Not yet tested due to build issues

**Status**: Implementation in progress. Recommended approach ready for testing.

## 1. Problem Analysis

### Symptoms

**What Works:**
- ✅ All standard tests (basic_pubsub, ping_pong, etc.) pass on Windows
- ✅ All tests including recovery_test pass on Linux
- ✅ Signal handler installation works correctly on both platforms
- ✅ Process crash detection and recovery triggering works

**What Doesn't Work:**
- ❌ `recovery_test` hangs on Windows (100% reproducible before fixes)
- ❌ Hang occurs during process recovery, not during initial crash
- ❌ Hang location: Opening brace of `main()` function (line 302 of recovery_test.cpp)

### Test Architecture

The `recovery_test` spawns three processes:

1. **Coordinator Process** (main): Spawns other processes, waits for result file
2. **Watchdog Process**: Waits for `Stop` message, writes result file on success
3. **Crasher Process**:
   - First run (occurrence=0): Calls `std::abort()` to trigger crash
   - Second run (occurrence=1): Sends `Stop` message to watchdog

**Expected Flow:**
```
1. Crasher starts (occurrence=0)
2. Crasher calls std::abort()
3. Signal handler catches SIGABRT, coordinator detects crash
4. Coordinator calls recover_if_required(crasher_piid)
5. New crasher process spawns (occurrence=1)  ← HANGS HERE ON WINDOWS
6. Recovered crasher sends Stop message
7. Watchdog receives Stop, writes "ok" to result file
8. All processes exit cleanly
```

### Stack Traces from Hung Processes

Using CDB debugger on hung processes:

**Process 1 (Watchdog):**
- Main thread: Waiting on condition variable (expected)
- Worker threads: Stuck in `Ring_R::wait_for_new_data()` waiting on semaphores (expected)

**Process 2 (Coordinator):**
- Main thread: Waiting for result file (expected)
- Worker threads: Stuck in `Ring_R::wait_for_new_data()` (expected)

**Process 3 (Recovered Crasher) - THE KEY ISSUE:**
```
Call Stack:
recovery_test.exe!main(int argc, char** argv) Line 302

Source Location: Line 302 is the OPENING BRACE of main():
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{  // <-- Line 302: STUCK HERE BEFORE ANY USER CODE
```

**Critical Finding**: The recovered process is stuck at the entry point of `main()` before executing ANY user code. This suggests the hang occurs during:
- C runtime initialization
- Static/global variable initialization
- Dynamic library loading
- Shared memory attachment during Boost.Interprocess initialization

---

## 2. Root Cause Identification

### Consensus from 4 Advanced LLMs

To identify the root cause, the issue was analyzed by 4 different large language models:
- Google Gemini 2.5 Pro
- OpenAI GPT O3 Pro
- OpenAI GPT-5 Pro
- OpenAI Codex

**Unanimous Conclusion (4/4 LLMs agreed):**

The root cause is **abandoned `ownership_mutex` locks in shared memory `Message_ring_W` control files**.

### Detailed Root Cause Analysis

**The Abandoned Lock Problem:**

1. **Before Crash:**
   - Crasher process creates `Message_ring_W` objects during initialization
   - Constructor calls `c.ownership_mutex.try_lock()` to acquire exclusive writer lock
   - If successful, stores PID in `c.ownership_pid` and proceeds

2. **During Crash:**
   - Process calls `std::abort()`
   - Signal handler is invoked, detects crash
   - Process terminates WITHOUT calling destructor
   - `ownership_mutex` remains LOCKED in shared memory
   - `ownership_pid` still contains dead process's PID

3. **After Recovery (Windows-specific issue):**
   - Coordinator spawns new process with occurrence incremented
   - New process enters `main()`
   - C++ runtime begins initialization
   - Early in initialization, static objects are constructed
   - `Message_ring_W` constructor tries to attach to existing shared memory
   - Attempts `c.ownership_mutex.try_lock()` on abandoned mutex
   - **Mutex is still locked from crashed process**
   - **Windows does NOT mark Boost.Interprocess mutexes as WAIT_ABANDONED**
   - `try_lock()` fails, throws `ring_acquisition_failure_exception()`
   - Exception during static initialization causes hang at entry to `main()`

### Why Linux Works But Windows Doesn't

**Linux (`fork() + exec()`):**
- Child process inherits parent's memory initially
- `exec()` replaces entire address space with new image
- Signal handlers reset to default
- Shared memory mapping is inherited but process-specific state is reset
- Linux kernel may handle abandoned locks differently

**Windows (`CreateProcess()`):**
- Child process created from scratch with fresh address space
- No memory state inherited from parent
- Shared memory must be explicitly remapped
- When remapping, Boost.Interprocess mutexes in invalid state are NOT automatically detected
- Windows kernel doesn't provide `WAIT_ABANDONED` status for user-space mutexes in shared memory

### File Naming Patterns

Understanding the file naming is crucial for implementing the fix:

**Function `get_base_filename(prefix, id, occurrence)`** (message.h:582-590):
```cpp
std::string get_base_filename(const string& prefix, uint64_t id, uint32_t occurrence = 0)
{
    std::stringstream stream;
    stream << std::hex << id;
    if (occurrence > 0) {
        stream << "_occ" << std::dec << occurrence;
    }
    return prefix + stream.str();
}
```

**Resulting Filenames:**

For a process with `instance_id = 0xABCD1234`, occurrence 0:
- Data file: `reqabcd1234` (no extension)
- Control file: `reqabcd1234_control`

After first recovery (occurrence 1):
- Data file: `reqabcd1234_occ1`
- Control file: `reqabcd1234_occ1_control`

**File Types Created by Each Process:**
- Request ring: `req{piid_hex}` and `req{piid_hex}_control`
- Reply ring: `rep{piid_hex}` and `rep{piid_hex}_control`

---

## 3. Implementation History

### Phase 1: Control File Deletion (Initial Attempt)

**Implementation**: Delete control files for crashed process before respawning

**Location**: `coordinator_impl.h:398-425`

**Code**:
```cpp
#ifdef _WIN32
    std::fprintf(stderr, "[COORDINATOR] Deleting control files for crashed process %llx\n", piid);

    std::ostringstream piid_hex;
    piid_hex << std::hex << piid;
    std::string piid_str = piid_hex.str();

    for (const auto& entry : fs::directory_iterator(s_mproc->m_directory, ec)) {
        if (entry.is_regular_file(ec)) {
            const std::string filename = path.filename().string();
            if (filename.find("_control") != std::string::npos &&
                filename.find(piid_str) != std::string::npos)
            {
                fs::remove(path, ec);
            }
        }
    }
#endif
```

**Result**: Not effective when tested alone
- Hypothesis: Only deleted control files, left data files
- May not have been triggered at the right time
- Pass rate remained at 0%

### Phase 2a: Robust Mutex with PID Tracking

**Implementation**: Add process ID tracking to detect dead mutex owners

**Location**: `ipc_rings.h:961` (Control structure), `ipc_rings.h:1565-1606` (Ring_W constructor)

**Changes**:

1. **Added to Control structure** (line 961):
```cpp
// PID of the process that currently owns the ring (for robust mutex detection)
std::atomic<uint32_t> ownership_pid{0};
```

2. **Modified Ring_W constructor** (lines 1565-1592):
```cpp
Ring_W(const std::string& directory,
       const std::string& data_filename,
       size_t             num_elements)
: Ring<T, false>::Ring(directory, data_filename, num_elements),
  c(*this->m_control)
{
    // Single writer across processes with robust mutex support
    uint32_t owner_pid = c.ownership_pid.load(std::memory_order_acquire);

    if (owner_pid != 0) {
        // There was a previous owner - check if still alive
        if (!is_process_alive(owner_pid)) {
            // Owner is dead - clear the PID
            std::fprintf(stderr, "[Ring_W] Detected abandoned mutex from dead process %u\n", owner_pid);
            c.ownership_pid.store(0, std::memory_order_release);
        }
    }

    if (!c.ownership_mutex.try_lock()) {
        throw ring_acquisition_failure_exception();
    }

    // Successfully acquired - store our PID
    c.ownership_pid.store(get_current_pid(), std::memory_order_release);
}
```

3. **Modified Ring_W destructor** (lines 1608-1616):
```cpp
~Ring_W()
{
    unblock_global();

    // Clear ownership before unlocking
    c.ownership_pid.store(0, std::memory_order_release);
    c.ownership_mutex.unlock();
}
```

**Helper Functions Used**:
```cpp
inline bool is_process_alive(uint32_t pid)
{
#ifdef _WIN32
    HANDLE hProcess = OpenProcess(PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION, FALSE, pid);
    if (hProcess == NULL) {
        return false;  // Process doesn't exist or no access
    }
    DWORD exitCode;
    GetExitCodeProcess(hProcess, &exitCode);
    CloseHandle(hProcess);
    return exitCode == STILL_ACTIVE;
#else
    return kill(pid, 0) == 0;
#endif
}

inline uint32_t get_current_pid()
{
#ifdef _WIN32
    return GetCurrentProcessId();
#else
    return getpid();
#endif
}
```

**Result**: 0% → 65% pass rate
- Significant improvement but not complete
- Problem: Detecting dead owner and clearing PID doesn't reset the mutex itself
- Mutex remains in locked state from crashed process
- 35% of tests still hung

### Phase 2a-Enhanced: Mutex Reconstruction with Placement-New

**Implementation**: When detecting abandoned mutex, reconstruct it using placement-new

**Location**: `ipc_rings.h:1565-1606` (Ring_W constructor - enhanced version)

**Code**:
```cpp
Ring_W(const std::string& directory,
       const std::string& data_filename,
       size_t             num_elements)
: Ring<T, false>::Ring(directory, data_filename, num_elements),
  c(*this->m_control)
{
    // Single writer across processes with robust mutex support
    uint32_t owner_pid = c.ownership_pid.load(std::memory_order_acquire);

    if (owner_pid != 0) {
        // There was a previous owner - check if still alive
        if (!is_process_alive(owner_pid)) {
            std::fprintf(stderr, "[Ring_W] Detected abandoned ownership_mutex from dead process %u, recovering\n",
                owner_pid);

            // Clear the PID to indicate no owner
            c.ownership_pid.store(0, std::memory_order_release);

            // AGGRESSIVE FIX: Reconstruct the mutex in-place using placement-new.
            // This is the Windows-specific workaround for abandoned mutexes that don't
            // get automatically marked as WAIT_ABANDONED.
            //
            // WARNING: This is potentially unsafe if another process is simultaneously
            // trying to access the same mutex, but given the owner is dead and we've
            // cleared the PID, no other process should be trying to acquire it.
            std::fprintf(stderr, "[Ring_W] Reconstructing abandoned mutex using placement-new\n");

            // Explicitly call destructor first (defensive - may not be necessary)
            c.ownership_mutex.~interprocess_mutex();

            // Reconstruct in place with default constructor
            new (&c.ownership_mutex) ipc::interprocess_mutex();
        }
    }

    if (!c.ownership_mutex.try_lock()) {
        throw ring_acquisition_failure_exception();
    }

    // Successfully acquired the lock - store our PID as the new owner
    c.ownership_pid.store(get_current_pid(), std::memory_order_release);
}
```

**Result**: 65% → 70% pass rate
- Improvement from Phase 2a but still not 100%
- Remaining 30% failures suggest:
  - Race conditions during reconstruction
  - Boost.Interprocess mutex may have OS-level state that placement-new can't reset
  - Timing issues where recovered process accesses mutex before reconstruction

**Test Output Example**:
```
Running: sintra_recovery_test
  Repetitions: 20, Timeout: 30s
  Progress: .F.....F.....F...... [20/20]

Result: FAIL
Passed: 14 / Failed: 6 / Total: 20
Pass Rate: 70.0%
Duration: avg=10.93s, min=2.64s, max=30.00s

Failure Details:
    Run #2: Test timed out after 30s
    Run #6: Test timed out after 30s
    Run #11: Test timed out after 30s
```

### Phase 1+2a Combined (Current Implementation - Not Yet Tested)

**Strategy**: Combine both approaches for maximum effectiveness
- **Primary fix**: Delete ALL ring files (data + control) before respawning → forces clean slate
- **Fallback fix**: Keep Phase 2a-enhanced mutex reconstruction in case any files aren't deleted

**Implementation**: Enhanced control file deletion in coordinator

**Location**: `coordinator_impl.h:398-433`

**Code**:
```cpp
inline
void Coordinator::recover_if_required(instance_id_type piid)
{
    assert(is_process(piid));
    if (m_requested_recovery.count(piid)) {
        // PHASE 1+2a COMBINED: Delete all ring files for the crashed process before respawning
        // This ensures the recovered process creates fresh ring buffers with clean locks
#ifdef _WIN32
        std::fprintf(stderr, "[COORDINATOR] Deleting all ring files for crashed process %llx before respawn\n",
            static_cast<unsigned long long>(piid));

        // Build the hex ID string to match against filenames
        std::ostringstream piid_hex;
        piid_hex << std::hex << piid;
        std::string piid_str = piid_hex.str();

        std::error_code ec;
        int deleted_count = 0;
        for (const auto& entry : fs::directory_iterator(s_mproc->m_directory, ec)) {
            if (entry.is_regular_file(ec)) {
                const auto& path = entry.path();
                const std::string filename = path.filename().string();

                // Delete ALL ring files (data + control) belonging to the crashed process
                // Patterns: req{piid_hex}, req{piid_hex}_occN, req{piid_hex}_control, req{piid_hex}_occN_control
                //           rep{piid_hex}, rep{piid_hex}_occN, rep{piid_hex}_control, rep{piid_hex}_occN_control
                if (filename.find(piid_str) != std::string::npos &&
                    (filename.find("req") == 0 || filename.find("rep") == 0))
                {
                    std::fprintf(stderr, "[COORDINATOR]   Removing: %s\n", filename.c_str());
                    if (fs::remove(path, ec)) {
                        deleted_count++;
                    } else if (ec) {
                        std::fprintf(stderr, "[COORDINATOR]   Failed to remove %s: %s\n",
                            filename.c_str(), ec.message().c_str());
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        std::fprintf(stderr, "[COORDINATOR] Deleted %d files for crashed process\n", deleted_count);
#endif

        // respawn
        auto& s = s_mproc->m_cached_spawns[piid];
        s_mproc->spawn_swarm_process(s);
    }
    else {
        // remove traces
        // ... [implement]
    }
}
```

**Key Improvements**:
1. Deletes BOTH data files and control files (not just control)
2. Matches on PID hex string AND file prefix (req/rep)
3. Better diagnostic logging with deleted_count
4. Error reporting if deletion fails
5. Combined with Phase 2a-enhanced fallback already in Ring_W constructor

**Expected Result**: Should achieve 95-100% pass rate
- If files are successfully deleted: Fresh ring buffers created, no abandoned locks
- If files can't be deleted: Fallback to Phase 2a-enhanced mutex reconstruction
- Double layer of protection

**Status**: Not yet tested due to build issues (hung recovery_test.exe processes locking executable)

### Build Status

Last build attempt failed due to Permission denied:
```
C:/Qt/Tools/mingw1310_64/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-w64-mingw32/13.1.0/../../../../x86_64-w64-mingw32/bin/ld.exe:
cannot open output file tests\sintra_recovery_test.exe: Permission denied
```

**Cause**: Hung recovery_test.exe processes from previous test runs locking the executable file

**Workaround Needed**: Kill all hung sintra test processes before rebuilding

---

## 5. Recommended Solution

### Approach: Layered Defense Strategy

The recommended solution uses **multiple layers of protection** to handle the abandoned mutex problem:

**Layer 1 (Primary)**: Delete all ring files before respawning
- Prevents recovered process from attaching to corrupted shared memory
- Forces creation of fresh ring buffers with clean locks
- Implemented in `Coordinator::recover_if_required()`

**Layer 2 (Fallback)**: Robust mutex with placement-new reconstruction
- Handles cases where files can't be deleted (permissions, timing, etc.)
- Detects dead mutex owner via PID tracking
- Reconstructs mutex in-place when abandoned
- Implemented in `Ring_W` constructor

**Layer 3 (Safety)**: Atomic PID tracking with memory ordering
- Prevents race conditions between processes
- Uses acquire/release semantics for cross-process synchronization
- Ensures PID is always consistent with mutex state

### Why This Approach

**Alternative Approaches Considered**:

1. **Switch to Windows-native mutexes with WAIT_ABANDONED**
   - Pros: Would get automatic abandoned mutex detection
   - Cons: Major refactoring, breaks cross-platform compatibility
   - Decision: Too invasive for header-only library

2. **Use file locking instead of shared memory mutexes**
   - Pros: OS automatically releases file locks on process death
   - Cons: Performance impact, major architectural change
   - Decision: Too disruptive to existing design

3. **Implement process monitoring and cleanup in coordinator**
   - Pros: Centralized recovery logic
   - Cons: Doesn't help with initial attachment at startup
   - Decision: Useful as Layer 1, but needs Layer 2 for completeness

4. **Add timeout to try_lock() with retry logic**
   - Pros: Simple to implement
   - Cons: Doesn't solve the underlying issue, just works around it
   - Decision: Not robust enough

**Why Layered Approach is Best**:
- Addresses problem at multiple levels (file system, shared memory, mutex)
- Minimal changes to existing code
- Maintains cross-platform compatibility
- Provides fallback if any layer fails
- Can be implemented incrementally and tested at each stage

### Implementation Priority

**High Priority (Must Fix)**:
1. ✅ Phase 2a: PID tracking in Ring_W (DONE - 65% pass rate)
2. ✅ Phase 2a-enhanced: Placement-new reconstruction (DONE - 70% pass rate)
3. ⚠️ Phase 1+2a combined: File deletion + reconstruction (IMPLEMENTED - NOT TESTED)
4. ⏳ Test Phase 1+2a combined implementation

**Medium Priority (Should Fix)**:
5. Phase 2b: Fix `_spawnv` argument bug in utility.h (see WINDOWS_RECOVERY_HANG_QUESTION.md)
6. Phase 2c: Move inline globals to function-local statics (reduce initialization complexity)

**Low Priority (Nice to Have)**:
7. Phase 3a: Switch to CreateProcessW for better Unicode handling
8. Add comprehensive logging for debugging future issues
9. Implement process monitoring in coordinator for proactive cleanup

## 6. Code Changes

### File: `sintra/include/sintra/detail/ipc_rings.h`

#### Change 1: Add ownership_pid to Control structure

**Location**: Line 961

**Before**:
```cpp
template<typename T, bool READ_ONLY_DATA>
struct Control
{
    std::atomic<size_t>                 leading_index{0};
    std::atomic<size_t>                 num_attached{0};
    ipc::interprocess_mutex             ownership_mutex;
    ipc::interprocess_condition_any     global_cv;
    std::atomic<uint32_t>               num_threads_to_wake{0};
    // ... other fields
};
```

**After**:
```cpp
template<typename T, bool READ_ONLY_DATA>
struct Control
{
    std::atomic<size_t>                 leading_index{0};
    std::atomic<size_t>                 num_attached{0};
    ipc::interprocess_mutex             ownership_mutex;
    ipc::interprocess_condition_any     global_cv;
    std::atomic<uint32_t>               num_threads_to_wake{0};

    // PID of the process that currently owns the ring (for robust mutex detection)
    std::atomic<uint32_t>               ownership_pid{0};

    // ... other fields
};
```

#### Change 2: Modify Ring_W constructor

**Location**: Lines 1565-1606

**Before**:
```cpp
Ring_W(const std::string& directory,
       const std::string& data_filename,
       size_t             num_elements)
: Ring<T, false>::Ring(directory, data_filename, num_elements),
  c(*this->m_control)
{
    if (!c.ownership_mutex.try_lock()) {
        throw ring_acquisition_failure_exception();
    }
}
```

**After** (Phase 2a-enhanced with placement-new):
```cpp
Ring_W(const std::string& directory,
       const std::string& data_filename,
       size_t             num_elements)
: Ring<T, false>::Ring(directory, data_filename, num_elements),
  c(*this->m_control)
{
    // Single writer across processes with robust mutex support
    // Check if there's a previous owner that may have crashed
    uint32_t owner_pid = c.ownership_pid.load(std::memory_order_acquire);

    if (owner_pid != 0) {
        // There was a previous owner - check if still alive
        if (!is_process_alive(owner_pid)) {

            // AGGRESSIVE FIX: Reconstruct the mutex in-place using placement-new.
            // This is the Windows-specific workaround for abandoned mutexes that don't

            //

            //
            // The destructor must have been implicitly called on the previous owner
            // (which may or may not have executed - hence the lock state), so we
            // reconstruct it with placement-new.
            std::fprintf(stderr, "[Ring_W] Reconstructing abandoned mutex using placement-new\n");

            // Explicitly call destructor first (defensive - may not be necessary)
            c.ownership_mutex.~interprocess_mutex();

            // Reconstruct in place with default constructor
            new (&c.ownership_mutex) ipc::interprocess_mutex();
        }
    }

    if (!c.ownership_mutex.try_lock()) {
        throw ring_acquisition_failure_exception();
    }

    // Successfully acquired the lock - store our PID as the new owner
    c.ownership_pid.store(get_current_pid(), std::memory_order_release);
}

## 7. Testing Methodology

### Test Infrastructure

**Test Runner**: `sintra/tests/run_tests.py`

**Key Features**:
- Configurable timeout per test run (default 5s, use 30s for recovery_test)
- Configurable repetitions (default 100, use 20-50 for recovery_test)
- Automatic process cleanup using `taskkill /F /T`
- Pre-cleanup of stuck processes on startup
- Progress display with colored output (. = pass, F = fail)
- Detailed statistics and failure reporting

**Test Command**:
```bash
cd sintra/tests
python run_tests.py --test recovery --repetitions 20 --timeout 30
```

**Options**:
- `--test NAME`: Run only specific test (e.g., "recovery", "ping_pong")
- `--repetitions N`: Number of times to run each test (default: 100)
- `--timeout SECONDS`: Timeout per test run (default: 5)
- `--build-dir PATH`: Path to build directory (default: ../build-ninja2)
- `--config CONFIG`: Debug or Release (default: Debug)
- `--verbose`: Show detailed output for each test run

### Recommended Test Sequence

**Step 1: Build with Current Changes**
```bash
cd sintra/build-ninja2
ninja
```

If build fails due to locked executable:
1. Kill all hung processes manually or wait for them to timeout
2. Retry build

**Step 2: Quick Validation Test** (5 runs)
```bash
cd sintra/tests
python run_tests.py --test recovery --repetitions 5 --timeout 30
```

Expected result with Phase 1+2a combined: 4-5 passes (80-100%)

**Step 3: Medium Confidence Test** (20 runs)
```bash
python run_tests.py --test recovery --repetitions 20 --timeout 30
```

Expected result: 18-20 passes (90-100%)

**Step 4: High Confidence Test** (100 runs)
```bash
python run_tests.py --test recovery --repetitions 100 --timeout 30
```

Expected result: 95-100 passes (95-100%)

**Step 5: Full Test Suite**
```bash
python run_tests.py --repetitions 100 --timeout 5
```

All tests should pass including recovery_test

### Interpreting Results

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Pass rate ≥ 95% for 100 runs
- ✅ No deadlocks (all failures are timeouts, not hangs)
- ✅ Diagnostic logging shows file deletion and/or mutex reconstruction
- ✅ Average test duration < 5 seconds

**Partial Success**:
- ⚠️ Pass rate 70-95%: Phase 1+2a working but has race conditions
- ⚠️ Check logs for "Failed to remove" errors
- ⚠️ May need additional synchronization

**Failure**:
- ❌ Pass rate < 70%: Phase 1+2a not more effective than Phase 2a-enhanced alone
- ❌ Investigate why file deletion isn't working
- ❌ Check coordinator logs for deletion errors

### Diagnostic Logging

The implementation includes extensive fprintf logging to stderr:

**From Coordinator** (coordinator_impl.h):
```
[COORDINATOR] Deleting all ring files for crashed process {piid} before respawn
[COORDINATOR]   Removing: req{piid}_control
[COORDINATOR]   Removing: req{piid}
[COORDINATOR]   Removing: rep{piid}_control
[COORDINATOR]   Removing: rep{piid}
[COORDINATOR] Deleted 4 files for crashed process
```

**From Ring_W Constructor** (ipc_rings.h):
```
[Ring_W] Detected abandoned ownership_mutex from dead process {pid}, recovering
[Ring_W] Reconstructing abandoned mutex using placement-new
```

**Viewing Logs**:

Redirect stderr to file:
```bash
python run_tests.py --test recovery --repetitions 5 2>recovery_log.txt
```

Or view in real-time (PowerShell):
```powershell
python run_tests.py --test recovery --repetitions 5 2>&1 | Tee-Object -FilePath recovery_log.txt
```

## 8. Technical Details

### Memory Ordering and Atomics

The `ownership_pid` field uses C++11 atomics with explicit memory ordering:

**Why Atomic**:
- Multiple processes access the field concurrently through shared memory
- Must prevent data races and ensure visibility across processes

**Memory Order Used**:

```cpp
// Load with acquire ordering
uint32_t owner_pid = c.ownership_pid.load(std::memory_order_acquire);

// Store with release ordering
c.ownership_pid.store(new_pid, std::memory_order_release);
```

**Why Acquire/Release**:
- `acquire`: Ensures all memory operations after the load see the effects of stores before the corresponding release store
- `release`: Ensures all memory operations before the store are visible to threads that do an acquire load
- Provides synchronization between processes accessing shared memory
- More efficient than `seq_cst` (sequentially consistent) when full sequential consistency isn't needed

**Synchronization Guarantee**:
- When Process A stores PID with release and Process B loads with acquire, Process B is guaranteed to see:
  - The correct PID value
  - All memory effects that happened before Process A's store (e.g., mutex state)

### Boost.Interprocess Mutex Internals

**Why Placement-New Works**:

`interprocess_mutex` on Windows is implemented using:
- Unnamed kernel mutex (CreateMutex with NULL name)
- Or file-mapped shared memory with custom synchronization primitives

When calling the destructor then placement-new:
```cpp
c.ownership_mutex.~interprocess_mutex();  // Releases kernel resources
new (&c.ownership_mutex) ipc::interprocess_mutex();  // Creates fresh mutex
```

This:
1. Destructor releases any kernel handles or resources
2. Placement-new constructs a new mutex object at the same memory location
3. New mutex is in unlocked state
4. Other processes see the new mutex when they next access it

**Limitations**:
- May not work if Boost.Interprocess caches handles elsewhere
- Race condition if multiple processes try to reconstruct simultaneously
- Some kernel-level state may not be fully reset

**Why 30% Still Fail**:
- Timing: Recovered process may attach before reconstruction happens
- Race: Multiple processes trying to reconstruct simultaneously
- Kernel state: Windows may have process-specific state that isn't reset

### Process ID Checking

**Windows Implementation**:
```cpp
bool is_process_alive(uint32_t pid)
{
    HANDLE hProcess = OpenProcess(PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION, FALSE, pid);
    if (hProcess == NULL) {
        return false;  // Process doesn't exist or no access
    }
    DWORD exitCode;
    GetExitCodeProcess(hProcess, &exitCode);
    CloseHandle(hProcess);
    return exitCode == STILL_ACTIVE;
}
```

**Why `PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION`**:
- Minimum required access right for checking if process is alive
- Doesn't require administrator privileges
- Works across user sessions in most cases
- More secure than `PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION`

**Edge Cases**:
- Process in zombie state: `OpenProcess` succeeds but `GetExitCodeProcess` returns exit code
- Process from different user: `OpenProcess` may fail with `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`
- PID reuse: Rare, but Windows may reuse PIDs after sufficient time

**PID Reuse Mitigation**:
- Windows doesn't reuse PIDs immediately (typically takes many process creations)
- Our use case: Checking PID shortly after crash, very low chance of reuse
- If reused: False negative (think process is alive) → mutex reconstruction doesn't happen
- Consequence: Fall back to previous behavior (try_lock fails) → not worse than before

### File Deletion Strategy

**Why Delete Both Data and Control Files**:

Original Phase 1 only deleted control files:
```cpp
if (filename.find("_control") != std::string::npos &&
    filename.find(piid_str) != std::string::npos)
```

Problem: Ring_W might attach to existing data file and create new control file, but with attachment count mismatch.

Enhanced Phase 1+2a deletes both:
```cpp
if (filename.find(piid_str) != std::string::npos &&
    (filename.find("req") == 0 || filename.find("rep") == 0))
```

Benefits:
- Forces complete recreation of ring buffers
- No partial state from crashed process
- Attachment count starts fresh at 1
- No risk of control/data file mismatch

**File Matching Logic**:

Match criteria:
1. Filename contains PID hex string (e.g., "abcd1234")
2. Filename starts with "req" or "rep"

Matches:
- ✅ `reqabcd1234`
- ✅ `reqabcd1234_control`
- ✅ `reqabcd1234_occ1`
- ✅ `reqabcd1234_occ1_control`
- ✅ `repabcd1234`
- ✅ `repabcd1234_control`

Doesn't match:
- ❌ `reqabcd1233` (different PID)
- ❌ `datafile_abcd1234` (doesn't start with req/rep)
- ❌ `abcd1234_control` (doesn't start with req/rep)

**Error Handling**:

Deletion errors are logged but don't prevent respawning:
```cpp
if (fs::remove(path, ec)) {
    deleted_count++;
} else if (ec) {
    std::fprintf(stderr, "[COORDINATOR] Failed to remove %s: %s\n",
        filename.c_str(), ec.message().c_str());
}
```

Reasons deletion might fail:
- File locked by another process
- Permission denied
- File system error
- File doesn't exist (race condition)

In these cases, Phase 2a-enhanced fallback (mutex reconstruction) handles it.

### Ring Buffer Attachment and Ownership

**Ring Buffer Lifecycle**:

1. **First Process Creates Ring**:
   ```cpp
   Ring_W constructor:
   - Creates data file and control file
   - Initializes Control structure in control file
   - Sets ownership_mutex, ownership_pid = 0
   - Calls try_lock() → succeeds (new mutex)
   - Stores ownership_pid = current PID
   - Sets num_attached = 1
   ```

2. **Other Processes Attach**:
   ```cpp
   Ring_R constructor:
   - Opens existing data and control files
   - Maps control file to memory
   - Increments num_attached
   - No mutex acquisition needed (readers don't need ownership_mutex)
   ```

3. **Writer Process Detaches**:
   ```cpp
   Ring_W destructor:
   - Clears ownership_pid = 0
   - Unlocks ownership_mutex
   - Decrements num_attached
   - If last detaching (num_attached == 0), deletes files
   ```

4. **Writer Process Crashes**:
   ```cpp
   Destructor never runs:
   - ownership_pid = crashed PID (non-zero)
   - ownership_mutex = LOCKED
   - num_attached not decremented
   - Files remain on disk
   ```

5. **Recovery Without Fix**:
   ```cpp
   New Ring_W constructor:
   - Attaches to existing control file
   - Finds ownership_pid = crashed PID
   - No detection of dead owner
   - Calls try_lock() → FAILS (mutex locked)
   - Throws ring_acquisition_failure_exception
   - Exception during static init → HANGS
   ```

6. **Recovery With Phase 1+2a Combined**:
   ```cpp
   Coordinator before respawn:
   - Deletes data and control files for crashed PID

   New Ring_W constructor:
   - No existing files found
   - Creates NEW data and control files
   - Fresh Control structure with clean mutex
   - try_lock() → SUCCEEDS
   - SUCCESS

   OR (if deletion failed):

   New Ring_W constructor:
   - Attaches to existing control file
   - Finds ownership_pid = crashed PID
   - Detects owner is dead (is_process_alive returns false)
   - Reconstructs mutex with placement-new
   - try_lock() → SUCCEEDS
   - SUCCESS
   ```

### Signal Handler and Recovery Flow

**Signal Handler Installation** (managed_process_impl.h:51-239):

```cpp
namespace sintra {

inline std::once_flag signal_handler_once_flag;

inline void install_signal_handler()
{
    std::call_once(signal_handler_once_flag, []() {
        // Install handlers for SIGSEGV, SIGABRT, SIGILL, SIGFPE
        // On crash:
        //   1. Set s_abnormal_termination = true
        //   2. Call std::exit(EXIT_FAILURE)
        //   3. Triggers exit handlers
    });
}
```

**Recovery Detection** (managed_process_impl.h):

```cpp
void Managed_process::~Managed_process()
{
    if (s_abnormal_termination) {
        // Don't run normal cleanup - process crashed
        // Coordinator will detect crash and call recover_if_required()
    } else {
        // Normal shutdown
        unpublish();
    }
}
```

**Recovery Trigger** (coordinator_impl.h:393-437):

```cpp
void Coordinator::recover_if_required(instance_id_type piid)
{
    if (m_requested_recovery.count(piid)) {
        // Phase 1: Delete files (NEW)
        // Phase 2: Respawn process
    }
}
```

**Full Flow**:
```
1. Crasher process calls std::abort()
2. Signal handler catches SIGABRT
3. Sets s_abnormal_termination = true
4. Calls std::exit(EXIT_FAILURE)
5. Managed_process destructor skips cleanup
6. Process terminates with exit code 1
7. Coordinator detects terminated child process
8. Coordinator calls recover_if_required(crasher_piid)
9. [NEW] Coordinator deletes ring files for crasher_piid
10. Coordinator spawns new process with occurrence++
11. [RECOVERY] New process enters main()
12. [RECOVERY] Static initialization begins
13. [RECOVERY] Ring_W constructor called
14. [SUCCESS - Path A] No existing files, creates fresh ring
15. [SUCCESS - Path B] Existing file but detects dead owner, reconstructs mutex
16. [SUCCESS] try_lock() succeeds, continues to user code
```

## 9. Known Issues

### Issue 1: Remaining 30% Failure Rate (Phase 2a-Enhanced)

**Symptoms**:
- Phase 2a-enhanced achieves 70% pass rate
- Remaining 30% still timeout at 30 seconds
- No error messages logged (process hangs silently)

**Likely Causes**:

1. **Race Condition in Placement-New**:
   - Multiple processes trying to reconstruct mutex simultaneously
   - Destruction and reconstruction not atomic
   - Another process accesses mutex during reconstruction window

2. **Boost.Interprocess Kernel State**:
   - Mutex may have Windows kernel objects (handles) that aren't reset by placement-new
   - Kernel may cache process-specific state that isn't visible to user space
   - Placement-new only resets user-space memory, not kernel objects

3. **Timing Issue**:
   - Recovered process attaches to shared memory BEFORE any other process detects dead owner
   - First process to attach after crash is the recovered process itself
   - No opportunity for reconstruction by another process

**Evidence**:
- Tests that pass: Existing process detects dead owner and reconstructs mutex before respawn
- Tests that fail: Recovered process is first to access shared memory, hits abandoned mutex
- This explains ~70/30 split: depends on race between respawn and detection

**Mitigation** (Phase 1+2a Combined):
- Delete files BEFORE respawning → recovered process creates fresh files
- Eliminates race: no existing files to attach to
- Fallback: If deletion fails, Phase 2a-enhanced still provides partial protection

### Issue 2: Build Blocked by Hung Processes

**Symptoms**:
```
ld.exe: cannot open output file tests\sintra_recovery_test.exe: Permission denied
```

**Cause**:
- Previous test runs left hung recovery_test.exe processes
- Processes have executable file locked (Windows behavior)
- Build system can't overwrite executable

**Workaround**:
1. Kill all sintra test processes manually before building:
   ```powershell
   Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like '*sintra*'} | Stop-Process -Force
   ```

2. Or wait for hung processes to timeout (if timeout is set)

3. Or reboot (nuclear option)

**Prevention**:
- run_tests.py includes pre-cleanup of stuck processes:
  ```python
  def __init__(self, ...):
      self._kill_all_sintra_processes()
  ```
- But doesn't help if build is attempted outside of run_tests.py

**Better Solution** (not yet implemented):
- Add cleanup script: `cleanup_hung_processes.py` or `.bat`
- Call before building in CMakeLists.txt or build script
- Or use ninja's ability to run commands before build

### Issue 3: Insufficient Diagnostic Logging

**Symptoms**:
- Tests fail but no indication of why
- Can't tell if file deletion happened
- Can't tell if mutex reconstruction happened
- Can't correlate failures with specific code paths

**Current Logging**:
- ✅ Coordinator logs file deletion
- ✅ Ring_W logs mutex reconstruction
- ❌ No logging when files are successfully created (fresh start)
- ❌ No logging when try_lock() fails
- ❌ No timestamps in logs (hard to correlate events)

**Improvement Needed**:
Add logging for all code paths:
```cpp
// In Ring_W constructor:
if (/* no existing files */) {
    std::fprintf(stderr, "[Ring_W] No existing ring found, creating fresh ring for PID %u\n",
        get_current_pid());
}

if (!c.ownership_mutex.try_lock()) {
    std::fprintf(stderr, "[Ring_W] FAILED to acquire ownership_mutex for PID %u\n",
        get_current_pid());
    throw ring_acquisition_failure_exception();
}
```

Add timestamps:
```cpp
auto now = std::chrono::system_clock::now();
auto ms = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::milliseconds>(now.time_since_epoch()).count();
std::fprintf(stderr, "[%lld] [Ring_W] ...\n", ms);
```

### Issue 4: No Verification That Deleted Files Were for Crashed Process

**Symptoms**:
- File deletion code deletes files matching PID hex string
- But doesn't verify those files actually belonged to crashed process
- Could accidentally delete files from alive process with similar PID

**Example**:
- Crashed PID: 0x1234ABCD → hex string "1234abcd"
- Alive PID: 0x1234ABCE → hex string "1234abce"
- Both contain "1234abc" substring
- Overly permissive matching could delete wrong files

**Current Protection**:
- Code uses `filename.find(piid_str)` which matches full hex string
- Example: "reqabcd1234" contains "abcd1234" fully
- Should be safe as long as hex conversion is correct

**Verification Needed**:
- Add assertion that piid_hex conversion produces expected format:
  ```cpp
  assert(piid_hex.str().length() == expected_hex_length);
  assert(piid_hex.str().find_first_not_of("0123456789abcdef") == std::string::npos);
  ```

### Issue 5: _spawnv Argument Bug (Separate Issue)

**Location**: `sintra/include/sintra/detail/utility.h`

**Description** (from WINDOWS_RECOVERY_HANG_QUESTION.md):

There's a bug in the `_spawnv` call where arguments are built incorrectly:
```cpp
// Current (potentially buggy):
std::vector<const char*> args;
args.push_back(executable.c_str());
for (size_t i = 0; i < arguments.size(); i++) {
    args.push_back(arguments[i].c_str());
}
args.push_back(nullptr);
int ret = _spawnv(_P_NOWAIT, executable.c_str(), args.data());
```

**Issue**: `arguments` vector is destroyed before `_spawnv` executes, potentially leading to dangling pointers.

**Priority**: Medium (doesn't affect current recovery hang, but could cause other issues)

**Status**: Not yet fixed (marked as Phase 2b in roadmap)

---

## 10. Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Required to Continue)

1. **Clear Hung Processes and Build**:
   ```powershell
   # Kill hung processes
   Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.ProcessName -like '*sintra*'} | Stop-Process -Force

   # Build
   cd sintra/build-ninja2
   ninja
   ```

2. **Test Phase 1+2a Combined Implementation**:
   ```bash
   cd sintra/tests
   python run_tests.py --test recovery --repetitions 20 --timeout 30 2>recovery_log.txt
   ```

3. **Analyze Results**:
   - Check pass rate (target: ≥95%)
   - Review recovery_log.txt for diagnostic messages
   - Verify file deletion is happening: Look for "[COORDINATOR] Deleted N files"
   - Verify fallback is working: Look for "[Ring_W] Reconstructing abandoned mutex"

### If Pass Rate ≥ 95%

**Success! Phase 1+2a combined is effective.**

Actions:
1. Run extended test (100 repetitions):
   ```bash
   python run_tests.py --test recovery --repetitions 100 --timeout 30
   ```

2. Run full test suite:
   ```bash
   python run_tests.py --repetitions 100 --timeout 5
   ```

3. If all tests pass consistently:
   - ✅ Consider the fix complete
   - Move to Phase 2b (fix _spawnv bug)
   - Add more diagnostic logging
   - Write comprehensive documentation

4. Prepare for commit:
   - Clean up any debug logging if excessive
   - Add code comments explaining the fix
   - Update TECHNICAL_FINDINGS.md with results
   - Create commit message documenting the fix

### If Pass Rate 70-95%

**Partial improvement but not sufficient.**

Investigation needed:
1. Check recovery_log.txt:
   - Are files being deleted? Look for "[COORDINATOR] Deleted N files"
   - Are there deletion errors? Look for "[COORDINATOR] Failed to remove"
   - Is mutex reconstruction happening? Look for "[Ring_W] Reconstructing"

2. If files are NOT being deleted:
   - File permissions issue
   - Wrong file matching pattern
   - Files locked by another process
   - Fix: Debug file deletion logic

3. If files ARE being deleted but still failing:
   - Timing issue: Recovered process starts before deletion completes?
   - Race condition: Multiple processes interfering?
   - Fix: Add synchronization or delay before respawn

4. If mutex reconstruction is happening frequently:
   - File deletion isn't working properly
   - Files are being preserved intentionally?
   - Fix: Investigate why existing files aren't being deleted

### If Pass Rate < 70%

**No improvement from Phase 2a-enhanced alone.**

This suggests Phase 1+2a combined isn't working as expected.

Critical investigation:
1. Verify code changes were compiled:
   ```bash
   # Check if .o files are newer than source
   ls -lt sintra/build-ninja2/tests/CMakeFiles/sintra_recovery_test.dir/
   ls -lt sintra/include/sintra/detail/coordinator_impl.h
   ```

2. Add more aggressive logging:
   ```cpp
   // At start of recover_if_required():
   std::fprintf(stderr, "[COORDINATOR] ENTERING recover_if_required for PID %llx\n", piid);

   // Before file iteration:
   std::fprintf(stderr, "[COORDINATOR] Starting file scan in directory: %s\n",
       s_mproc->m_directory.c_str());

   // For each file checked:
   std::fprintf(stderr, "[COORDINATOR] Checking file: %s (contains piid: %s, starts with req/rep: %s)\n",
       filename.c_str(),
       (filename.find(piid_str) != std::string::npos ? "YES" : "NO"),
       ((filename.find("req") == 0 || filename.find("rep") == 0) ? "YES" : "NO"));
   ```

3. Consider alternative approaches:
   - Use Windows-native mutexes with WAIT_ABANDONED (Phase 3a)
   - Implement file locking instead of shared memory mutexes
   - Add coordinator-based mutex management

### Recommended Next Implementation (Phase 2b)

Once recovery_test is stable (≥95% pass rate), proceed to fix the _spawnv bug:

**File**: `sintra/include/sintra/detail/utility.h`

**Issue**: Arguments vector destroyed before _spawnv executes

**Fix**:
```cpp
// Before (buggy):
std::vector<const char*> args;
args.push_back(executable.c_str());
for (size_t i = 0; i < arguments.size(); i++) {
    args.push_back(arguments[i].c_str());
}
args.push_back(nullptr);
int ret = _spawnv(_P_NOWAIT, executable.c_str(), args.data());

// After (fixed):
std::vector<std::string> args_storage;  // Keep strings alive
std::vector<const char*> args;

args_storage.push_back(executable);
args.push_back(args_storage.back().c_str());

for (size_t i = 0; i < arguments.size(); i++) {
    args_storage.push_back(arguments[i]);
    args.push_back(args_storage.back().c_str());
}
args.push_back(nullptr);

int ret = _spawnv(_P_NOWAIT, executable.c_str(), args.data());
```

**Testing**: Run all tests to ensure spawning still works correctly.

### Long-Term Improvements

1. **Enhanced Diagnostic Logging**:
   - Add timestamps to all log messages
   - Log all code paths (success and failure)
   - Add log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
   - Make logging configurable via environment variable

2. **Process Monitoring in Coordinator**:
   - Periodically check all registered processes are alive
   - Proactively clean up abandoned resources
   - Don't wait for crash to trigger cleanup

3. **Automated Testing**:
   - Add recovery_test to CI/CD pipeline
   - Run with high repetition count (100+)
   - Fail build if pass rate < 95%

4. **Cross-Platform Validation**:
   - Verify fix doesn't break Linux
   - Test on other Windows versions (7, 8, 10, 11)
   - Test with different compilers (MSVC, Clang on Windows)

5. **Performance Analysis**:
   - Measure overhead of PID tracking
   - Measure cost of file deletion
   - Optimize if necessary (but correctness > performance)

6. **Documentation**:
   - Add architectural documentation for recovery mechanism
   - Document all failure modes and mitigations
   - Add troubleshooting guide

## Appendix B: Alternative Approaches (Not Implemented)

### Approach 1: Windows-Native Mutexes

**Concept**: Replace Boost.Interprocess mutexes with Windows-native mutexes that support WAIT_ABANDONED.

**Implementation**:
```cpp
// Use CreateMutex with name
HANDLE hMutex = CreateMutexW(NULL, FALSE, L"Global\\sintra_ring_abcd1234");

// Wait with abandonment detection
DWORD result = WaitForSingleObject(hMutex, INFINITE);
if (result == WAIT_ABANDONED) {
    // Mutex was abandoned - we now own it in clean state
}
```

**Pros**:
- Native Windows support for abandoned mutex detection
- No need for placement-new hacks
- More robust

**Cons**:
- Breaks cross-platform compatibility (would need #ifdef everywhere)
- Major refactoring required
- Changes fundamental architecture
- Doesn't work with Boost.Interprocess framework

**Decision**: Not chosen due to invasiveness and compatibility concerns.

### Approach 2: File Locking Instead of Shared Memory

**Concept**: Use file-based locking (flock/LockFileEx) instead of shared memory mutexes.

**Implementation**:
```cpp
// Windows
HANDLE hLockFile = CreateFileW(L"ring_abcd1234.lock", ...);
OVERLAPPED ovl = {0};
LockFileEx(hLockFile, LOCKFILE_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK, 0, 1, 0, &ovl);

// OS automatically releases lock when process dies
```

**Pros**:
- OS automatically releases file locks on process death
- No abandoned lock problem
- Simple and reliable

**Cons**:
- Performance overhead (file system operations vs memory operations)
- Still need shared memory for actual data
- Mixed locking mechanisms (file lock + shared memory)
- Architectural mismatch with current design

**Decision**: Not chosen due to performance concerns and architectural mismatch.

### Approach 3: Lock-Free Ring Buffer

**Concept**: Redesign ring buffer to be completely lock-free using atomic operations only.

**Implementation**:
```cpp
// Use atomic CAS operations instead of mutexes
while (true) {
    size_t old_leading = c.leading_index.load();
    size_t new_leading = old_leading + 1;
    if (c.leading_index.compare_exchange_strong(old_leading, new_leading)) {
        break;  // Successfully acquired slot
    }
}
```

**Pros**:
- No locks = no abandoned lock problem
- Better performance (no blocking)
- Scales better with multiple processes

**Cons**:
- Major redesign of entire ring buffer architecture
- ABA problem with atomic operations
- Memory reclamation complexity
- Debugging difficulty
- Current code assumes exclusive writer lock

**Decision**: Not chosen due to scope (complete redesign) and complexity.

### Approach 4: Coordinator-Managed Ownership

**Concept**: Have coordinator track and manage all ring buffer ownership instead of processes managing themselves.

**Implementation**:
```cpp
// Process requests ownership from coordinator
instance_id_type ring_id = coord.acquire_ring_ownership(ring_name);

// Coordinator tracks ownership and can reclaim on crash
void Coordinator::process_crashed(instance_id_type piid) {
    for (auto& ring : owned_rings[piid]) {
        ring.revoke_ownership();
    }
}
```

**Pros**:
- Centralized ownership tracking
- Coordinator can clean up all resources on crash
- No race conditions with ownership

**Cons**:
- Performance overhead (RPC to coordinator for every ring acquisition)
- Single point of failure (coordinator)
- Doesn't help with initial attachment at startup
- Coordinator itself could crash

**Decision**: Not chosen due to performance overhead and doesn't solve startup problem.

## Appendix C: Test Results History

### Baseline (Before Any Fixes)

| Test Run | Pass Rate | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Initial | 0% (0/20) | All tests hung at main() entry, 30s timeout |

### Phase 2a: PID Tracking Only

| Test Run | Pass Rate | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Run 1 | 65% (13/20) | First test of PID tracking |
| Run 2 | 60% (12/20) | Some variation in pass rate |
| Run 3 | 70% (14/20) | Variation suggests race condition |
| Average | 65% | Significant improvement from 0% |

### Phase 2a-Enhanced: PID Tracking + Placement-New

| Test Run | Pass Rate | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| Run 1 | 70% (14/20) | Improvement over Phase 2a |
| Run 2 | 75% (15/20) | Higher success rate |
| Run 3 | 65% (13/20) | Some variation remains |
| Average | 70% | Consistent ~5% improvement over Phase 2a |

**Observations**:
- Pass rate varies run-to-run (suggests race conditions)
- Placement-new provides incremental improvement
- Still far from 95% target
- No pattern in which runs fail (random)

### Phase 1+2a Combined (Expected Results)

| Test Run | Expected Pass Rate | Reasoning |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| First | 85-95% | File deletion should prevent most failures |
| Extended | 90-100% | With fallback, should be highly reliable |

**Prediction**:
- If file deletion works properly: 95%+ pass rate
- If file deletion has issues: 70-85% pass rate (same as Phase 2a-enhanced)
- If file deletion and fallback both fail: 0-10% pass rate (broken)

## Appendix D: Debugging Techniques Used

### 1. CDB (Windows Debugger)

**Command to Attach**:
```batch
"C:\Program Files\Windows Kits\10\Debuggers\x64\cdb.exe" -p <PID>
```

**Useful Commands**:
```
~*k          - Stack traces for all threads
~*kn         - Stack traces with frame numbers
lm           - List loaded modules
!locks       - Show lock information
.frame N     - Switch to frame N
dv           - Display local variables
dt           - Display type information
```

**Key Finding**: Recovered process stuck at main() line 302 (opening brace) before any user code.

### 2. Process Monitor (Sysinternals)

**Usage**: Monitor file system and registry operations

**Filters Set**:
- Process Name contains "sintra"
- Operation is CreateFile, ReadFile, WriteFile
- Path contains process directory

**Key Finding**: Could show if files are being deleted successfully during recovery.

### 3. Diagnostic Logging

**Strategy**: Add fprintf to stderr at critical points

**Benefits**:
- Cross-process logging to stderr
- No dependency on logging library
- Synchronous output (buffering disabled with stderr)
- Can correlate events across processes with timestamps

**Locations**:
- Before/after file deletion
- Before/after mutex operations
- When detecting dead process
- When reconstructing mutex

### 4. Test Repetition Analysis

**Method**: Run same test many times, analyze patterns

**Command**:
```bash
python run_tests.py --test recovery --repetitions 100 --timeout 30
```

**Analysis**:
- Pass/fail distribution: Random or clustered?
- Timing: Do failures take longer?
- Patterns: Do first N always fail? Do last N always pass?

**Findings**:
- Failures appear random (no pattern)
- All failures timeout at 30s (no quick failures)
- Suggests race condition rather than deterministic bug

### 5. Multiple LLM Consensus

**Method**: Analyze problem with multiple AI models independently

**Models Used**:
- Google Gemini 2.5 Pro
- OpenAI GPT O3 Pro
- OpenAI GPT-5 Pro
- OpenAI Codex

**Process**:
1. Present problem to each model independently
2. Collect root cause analyses
3. Look for consensus (4/4 agreed)
4. High confidence in unanimous conclusion

**Result**: All 4 models independently identified abandoned mutex as root cause.

### 6. Git Bisect (If Bug Was Regression)

**Not Used** (problem existed from beginning) but would use:

```bash
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD
git bisect good <known-good-commit>
# Git automatically checks out commits, test each:
python run_tests.py --test recovery --repetitions 5
git bisect good  # or bad
# Repeat until bug-introducing commit found
```

## Appendix E: Questions for Code Review

When reviewing this implementation, consider:

1. **Memory Ordering**:
   - Is acquire/release sufficient for ownership_pid synchronization?
   - Should we use seq_cst for stronger guarantees?
   - Are there any other memory ordering issues?

2. **Placement-New Safety**:
   - Is it safe to call destructor + placement-new on interprocess_mutex?
   - Could this corrupt Boost.Interprocess internal state?
   - What if another process is accessing the mutex during reconstruction?

3. **File Deletion Completeness**:
   - Are we deleting all necessary files?
   - Could deletion fail silently (error checking adequate)?
   - What if filesystem doesn't support deletion of mapped files?

4. **Race Conditions**:
   - Window between PID check and mutex reconstruction?
   - Multiple processes trying to reconstruct simultaneously?
   - Recovered process attaching before deletion completes?

5. **Error Handling**:
   - What if is_process_alive() fails (access denied)?
   - What if file iteration fails (corrupted directory)?
   - Should we retry deletion if it fails?

6. **Platform-Specific Behavior**:
   - Does this work on all Windows versions (7, 8, 10, 11)?
   - Does this break Linux (did we verify)?
   - What about other platforms (macOS)?

7. **Performance Impact**:
   - Cost of PID checking on every Ring_W construction?
   - Cost of file iteration during recovery?
   - Acceptable overhead?

8. **Testing Coverage**:
   - Is 20 repetitions sufficient?
   - Should we test with more processes?
   - Should we test with different crash scenarios?

9. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Should we reconsider Windows-native mutexes?
   - Should we add coordinator-based cleanup?
   - Is there a simpler solution we missed?

10. **Long-Term Maintenance**:
    - Is this code self-documenting enough?
    - Should we add more comments?
    - Should we add unit tests for individual components?
